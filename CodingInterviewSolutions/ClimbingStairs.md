You are climbing a staircase that has n steps. You can take the steps either 1 or 2 at a time. Calculate how many distinct ways you can climb to the top of the staircase.

Example

For n = 1, the output should be
solution(n) = 1;

For n = 2, the output should be
solution(n) = 2.

You can either climb 2 steps at once or climb 1 step two times.

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

[memory limit] 1 GB

[input] integer n

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 50.

[output] integer

It's guaranteed that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

[JavaScript] Syntax Tips

// Prints help message to the console
// Returns a string
function helloWorld(name) {
    console.log("This prints to the console when you Run Tests");
